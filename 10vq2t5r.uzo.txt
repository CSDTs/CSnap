Border color functions.

Added functions to Set, Get and Change border color.

To test,:
Open CSnap locally.
Do a File-> Import-> (a local copy of Graffiti.xml)
In the script, remove the "set border color to pen color" block.
Sub in, "Set border shade to" and change the default to 0.
Run the app to see that the border color is now black.

For further testing, lower in the script, (the if-else statement) you can sub in the "change border shade by ?" or "set border shade to" blocks.

Future consideration: Should we get rid of the "Set border color to" block?
